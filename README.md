# Mini-Contest 2: Multi-Agent Adversarial Pacman

This repository contains the code for the Mini-Contest 2: Multi-Agent Adversarial Pacman, a project for CS 275: Artificial Life for Computer Graphics and Vision. The project involves developing multi-agent systems using Q-learning and evolutionary algorithms to create competitive Pacman agents.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement a dynamic and competitive multi-agent environment where agents utilize Q-learning and evolutionary strategies to optimize their gameplay. The agents will demonstrate advanced strategic thinking, adaptability, and competitive behaviors.

## Features

- Multi-Agent Environment: Agents control both Pacman and ghosts in a team-based capture-the-flag variant of Pacman.
- Q-learning: Agents use Q-learning to optimize their decision-making process based on the game state.
- Evolutionary Algorithms: Strategies that perform well propagate their traits to successive generations, enhancing overall strategic capabilities.
- Real-Time Strategy Optimization: Agents continuously assess their performance during gameplay and adjust their strategies accordingly.
